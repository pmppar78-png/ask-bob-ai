          <strong>Ask Bob AI provides educational guidance only and is not a substitute for professional advice, assessment, or services.</strong> All information is provided for general educational purposes. You are solely responsible for verifying information and ensuring all work is performed safely and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>Educational Information Only</h2>
      <p>
        Ask Bob AI is an educational resource designed to help users understand home improvement and automotive maintenance concepts, plan projects, and develop informed questions for professionals. The guidance provided represents general best practices and educational information, not specific professional advice for your unique situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every building, home, vehicle, and project has unique characteristics that require hands-on assessment by qualified professionals. General guidance cannot account for hidden conditions, structural variations, electrical configurations, plumbing systems, vehicle-specific engineering, or other factors that professionals identify through direct inspection.
      </p>

      <h2>Not Professional Advice</h2>
      <p>
        The information provided through Ask Bob AI does not constitute professional advice of any kind, including but not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Engineering advice:</strong> Structural calculations, load analyses, foundation assessments, and engineering specifications require licensed professional engineers who can evaluate your specific conditions and provide certified assessments.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal advice:</strong> Building codes, permit requirements, zoning regulations, property boundaries, easements, and legal compliance vary by jurisdiction and require consultation with local authorities and, when necessary, licensed attorneys.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical advice:</strong> Questions about health risks, chemical exposure, safety equipment effectiveness, or injury prevention should be directed to qualified medical or occupational safety professionals.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial advice:</strong> Project budgeting, financing options, insurance coverage, property valuation, and investment decisions require consultation with qualified financial professionals.</li>
        <li><strong>Contractor services:</strong> Ask Bob AI does not perform contracting work, inspections, installations, or repairs. All physical work must be performed by you or qualified professionals.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Licensed Professional Requirements</h2>
      <p>
        Many types of work legally require licensed professionals. Depending on your jurisdiction, this typically includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Electrical work beyond basic fixture replacement</li>
        <li>Plumbing work involving supply lines, drain modifications, or gas connections</li>
        <li>Structural modifications to load-bearing elements</li>
        <li>HVAC installation and repair</li>
        <li>Gas appliance installation and repair</li>
        <li>Roofing work in some jurisdictions</li>
        <li>Work requiring permits and inspections</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Always verify licensing requirements with your local building department before beginning work. Performing work without required permits or licenses can result in fines, required removal of completed work, insurance complications, and safety hazards.
      </p>

      <h2>Safety Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Home improvement and automotive projects involve inherent risks including but not limited to electrical shock, falls, cuts, burns, crushing injuries, chemical exposure, fire, and structural collapse. By using Ask Bob AI, you acknowledge these risks and accept full responsibility for your safety and the safety of others.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are responsible for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for each task</li>
        <li>Following all safety warnings and manufacturer instructions</li>
        <li>Ensuring proper ventilation when working with chemicals or in enclosed spaces</li>
        <li>Using proper lifting techniques and equipment</li>
        <li>De-energizing electrical circuits before work and verifying with a voltage tester</li>
        <li>Using proper vehicle support (jack stands, not just jacks) when working under vehicles</li>
        <li>Working with a partner when safety requires it</li>
        <li>Knowing your limitations and stopping when unsure</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Accuracy Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        While Ask Bob AI strives to provide accurate, helpful information, we cannot guarantee accuracy, completeness, or timeliness. Limitations include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Code variations:</strong> Building codes differ by jurisdiction, change over time, and may have local amendments. Information about codes is general and may not reflect current requirements in your area.</li>
        <li><strong>Vehicle specifications:</strong> Torque specs, fluid capacities, part numbers, and procedures vary by year, make, model, engine, and sometimes production date. Always verify with manufacturer service information.</li>
        <li><strong>Material specifications:</strong> Product formulations, ratings, and approved applications change. Always check current manufacturer specifications and local code acceptance.</li>
        <li><strong>AI limitations:</strong> As an AI system, Ask Bob AI may occasionally produce inaccurate information. Critical specifications should always be verified with authoritative sources.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Automotive Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        Automotive repair involves significant safety risks. Improper repairs can result in vehicle failure, accidents, injuries, and death. The guidance provided is educational and does not replace professional mechanical assessment or manufacturer service procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always use factory service information for critical specifications including torque values, fluid types and capacities, and repair procedures. If you are uncertain about any aspect of a repair, consult a qualified automotive technician. Never compromise on brake system, steering, suspension, or other safety-critical repairs.
      </p>
